# Intelligent Embedded Systems for Smart Traffic Management
This repository contains the video for the project report submitted as a part of the Internally Funded Student Project initiative of SSN College of Engineering. 
The video is a simulation of a vehicular intersection using the Eclipse SUMO software. A Q-learning based reinforcement model is deployed to control the traffic phases and the resulting vehicular densities on each arm of the junction is observed.
